# Library

## Overview
An application that can be used to create a library of various content/media. 

As a user, I can:
- Add books to my library
- View my books

This application is split up into two parts. frontend and backend. the frontend is a dead simple vue application that allows a user add books and view their books. the backend is a nodeJS server that we're using as a stand-in jerry-rigged DWN. 

## Objectives
We're using this simple application to test the following:
- Using HTTP multipart requests as our serialization protocol
- protocols proposal
- links proposal
- DWN Collections in general
